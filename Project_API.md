# How does VR Help in Metaverse:
The VR headset will surely help you escape the real world and interact in the digital world seamlessly. In this virtual environment, one can take part in medias and also feel them around.
As a concept, the term **Metaverse** was first introduced in a sci-fi novel **Snow Crash** (1992) by author Neal Stephenson and he describes Metaverse to be a virtual environment where the protagonist can come escaping mundane real world.

This is like an open and shared virtual world that allows users to explore and communicate with varieties of virtual spaces, services and content in a three-dimensional space. VR headset and AR glasses are extremely useful in terms of getting an access to an alternative reality.
